# Void Reaver Player Character
An expansion upon [LuaFubuki's Void Reaver Mod](https://thunderstore.io/package/LuaFubuki/Void_Reaver/) that features my personal improvements, bugfixes, and more!

## Features
* All abilities of LuaFubuki's original Void Reaver mod.
* (Optional) Fresh icons for all the abilities and the survivor.
* Tons of new configuration options to personalize your experience and tweak nearly all facets of the mod.

## Important Notes
* It should be unsaid, but **make sure your config matches everybody else's** in multiplayer. If you see someone floating, or in the ground, your configuration (or theirs) isn't matched. There's a lot of graphics related tweaks here that might make for an inconsistent experience if they aren't matched.
* If you are just starting out, there's lots of configs that are sorted as cleanly as they can be. If you dislike something mechanically, you can probably just change it yourself! If a configuration option is missing, please let me know.

## Need to contact me?
* You can find me in the RoR2 modding discord. I am nicknamed `Xan`, my discriminator is #1760.
